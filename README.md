- Hi, I’m @letmegobacktosleep
- I am currently attempting to develop my own hall-effect keyboard

I am strongly against keyboards having a polling rate >1KHz,
because unlike a mouse which has audible _and_ tactile feedback,
or almost instant visual feedback when it comes to moving it around,
keyboards typically have very little visual feedback, 
and a tactile feedback which either doesn't align with
the actuation of the key, or no tactility on linears,
which already messes with, and therefore destroys any
reason for the _absolute highest_ polling rate possible.

Even with hall-effect keyboards where you only have to
move the key approximately 0.2mm to have it actuate reliably,
the visual feedback on the screen is nowhere near as much
due to almost all games having some kind of "movement acceleration"
which makes the difference between 2ms latency (worst case at 1KHz)
and 0.125 latency (best case at 8KHz) imperceptible.
